This project was developed during college as part of an interdisciplinary integration project (TCC). The Healthy Meal Manager Mobile App is a user-friendly Flutter application designed to help users manage their healthy meal routines and receive timely notifications. The app connects to a robust backend API built with Spring Boot, which handles meal planning, user data, and notifications.

The mobile app is built using Flutter and Dart, ensuring a smooth and responsive cross-platform experience for both Android and iOS users. It follows modern development practices and integrates seamlessly with the backend API for data management. The app features an intuitive user interface, designed with usability in mind, and leverages Flutter's rich widget library to deliver a polished experience.

For development, the app is tested on both physical devices and Android Studio emulators. It uses JWT-based authentication to securely communicate with the backend, ensuring user data is protected. The app is designed to be scalable and maintainable, making it easy to add new features or improvements in the future.
